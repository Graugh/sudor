Zero-Crossing (decision-directed):
Single sample per symbol, fragile to frequency offsets and carrier recovery errors. Only values of sample used.

Gardner (non-data-aided):
Two samples per symbol required

Early-Late (non-data-aided):
Requires three samples per symbol (value of sample read)

Mueller-Muller (decision-directed):
Offset calculation based on single sample per symbol. Requires knowledge of symbol assigned to previous sumbol (possibility of error propagation)

Ranked by slowest clock required:
1. Zero-Crossing
2. Mueller-Muller
3. Garnder
4. Early-Late

Most complex (implementation-wise):
1. Early-Late
2. Mueller-Muller
3. Gardner
4. Zero-Crossing
